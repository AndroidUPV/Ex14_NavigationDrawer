# Ex14_NavigationDrawer
Lecture 02 - Development of Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

The user can navigate through six different Fragments by means of a Navigation Drawer.
- Navigation is automatically handled by the NavController by using the same Id for the Fragments in the Navigation graph and the MenuItems in the Menu associated to the NavigationView.
- The ActionBar is setup to work with the NavController, so that its title is updated when navigating
